# 👋 Hey, I’m Fabio

Full-stack MERN dev with a surfboard in the brain and startup ideas in the pipeline.  
Focused on **Next.js** + **GSAP**, learning **React Native**, and shipping freelance web experiences (PWA-ready).  
Always chasing waves, good eats, and momentum. 🚀🌊

## ⚡ What’s in this repo

- Real, hands-on projects: private freelance work (where allowed), public experimental builds, and exercises from courses I’m taking or have taken.  
- Scroll-driven storytelling with video/motion, interactive experiments, and early React Native proofs-of-concept.  

If something catches your eye: **open the code, fork it, poke around the commits**.  
Drop a ⭐ if you vibe with it. No pressure, just respect.

## 🌍 Outside the terminal

- Big into the **ocean**—trying to become a surfer (debugging is warm-up).  
- Food explorer.  
- Snowboard when there’s snow.  
- Traveler when inspiration calls.  
- Startup energy: one idea away from “launch” (for real… maybe).
